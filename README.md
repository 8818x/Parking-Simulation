## Introduction

The provided code consists of two separate parts:

1. **Arduino Sketch for IR Sensor Monitoring with LED Feedback**: This part of the code is meant to be uploaded to an Arduino board connected to IR sensors and LEDs. It monitors the sensor values and controls LEDs based on the sensor readings. Additionally, it constructs JSON-formatted data containing the sensor values and sends it to the serial monitor at a specified interval.

2. **ESP8266 Sketch for MQTT Communication**: This part of the code is intended to run on an ESP8266 microcontroller, facilitating communication with an MQTT broker. It connects to a specified Wi-Fi network, establishes a connection with the MQTT broker, and publishes data obtained from the serial monitor to an MQTT topic. It also listens for incoming data from the serial monitor and publishes it to another MQTT topic.

## Instructions

### Arduino Sketch

1. Upload the Arduino sketch to your Arduino board connected to IR sensors and LEDs.
2. Ensure that the correct pin numbers for LEDs and IR sensors are specified in the code.
3. Monitor the serial monitor to view the sensor readings and the constructed JSON-formatted data.

### ESP8266 Sketch

1. Upload the ESP8266 sketch to your ESP8266 microcontroller.
2. Provide the required Wi-Fi network credentials, MQTT broker details, and MQTT client information in the code.
3. Monitor the serial monitor for connection status and MQTT communication logs.

## Dependencies

- For the Arduino Sketch:
  - None

- For the ESP8266 Sketch:
  - [ESP8266WiFi](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi)
  - [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)

Ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE before uploading the sketches.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholder values such as Wi-Fi SSID, password, MQTT broker details, and MQTT client information with your actual credentials and server information.
- Verify and adjust the pin numbers used for LEDs and IR sensors based on your hardware setup.
- Monitor the serial monitor for debugging information and communication logs.
